# Engineering Photosynthetic Melanocytes: A CRISPR-Based Approach to Introduce Chloroplast-Like Functionality into Mammalian Pigment Cells

# Abstract
This project explores the theoretical feasibility of using CRISPR-Cas9 to endow mammalian melanocytes with chloroplast-like photosynthetic functions. The concept involves introducing genes responsible for photosynthetic pigment production, electron transport, and carbon fixation into melanocytes, potentially allowing light-driven ATP and NADPH generation. The research integrates synthetic biology, cellular bioengineering, and metabolic reprogramming to investigate minimal gene sets and cellular modifications required for partial photosynthetic capability in human or mammalian skin cells.

# Background and Rationale

Melanocytes produce melanin to protect against ultraviolet (UV) radiation by absorbing light and dissipating it as heat. Chloroplasts, in contrast, absorb light to convert it into chemical energy. The structural and functional overlap — both involve pigment-containing organelles — inspires the idea of melanocytes acting as “light-harvesting” biofactories.

However, mammalian cells lack the internal machinery for photosynthesis. To achieve chloroplast-like function, one must introduce:

1. Genes encoding photosystem I & II complexes.

2. Components of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase.

3. Enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cycle (carbon fixation).

4. Systems for pigment biosynthesis (chlorophyll a/b, carotenoids) compatible with the cellular environment.

# Objectives

1. Identify minimal photosynthetic gene set transferable to eukaryotic (non-plant) cells.

2. Design CRISPR-based gene integration strategy for stable expression in melanocytes.

3. Evaluate metabolic compatibility between photosynthetic and melanin pathways.

4. Assess in vitro photosynthetic activity, pigment expression, and cell viability.

# Methods
## Phase 1: Bioinformatic and Theoretical Design

* Comparative genomics: Identify the minimal gene set from cyanobacteria (e.g., Synechocystis sp.) or microalgae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii).

* Codon optimization: Adjust for mammalian expression systems.

* Target loci selection: Choose safe-harbor genomic regions (e.g., AAVS1 site) for CRISPR-mediated insertion.

* Pathway modeling: Use metabolic network simulations to predict energy balance and redox flux.

## Phase 2: Genetic Engineering

* Construct design: Assemble synthetic operons encoding:

* Photosystem I & II subunits (psaA, psbA, psbD, etc.)

* ATP synthase subunits (atpA, atpB)

* Rubisco (rbcL, rbcS) and supporting Calvin cycle enzymes.

* CRISPR delivery system: Use lentiviral or nanoparticle vectors to insert genes into cultured melanocytes.

* Organelle engineering: Introduce synthetic membranes or protein scaffolds mimicking thylakoids within melanosomes (possible co-option of melanosomes as “proto-chloroplasts”).

## Phase 3: Functional Testing

* Light exposure assays: Measure ATP/NADPH generation and carbon fixation rates under light vs. dark conditions.

* Spectroscopy: Verify chlorophyll absorption peaks (around 430 nm and 662 nm).

* Microscopy: Electron microscopy to visualize thylakoid-like structures.

* Metabolic profiling: Detect shifts in energy metabolism (e.g., glucose utilization reduction).

## Phase 4: Optimization and Safety

* Incorporate photosynthetic protection mechanisms (e.g., carotenoids to prevent oxidative damage).

* Evaluate cytotoxicity and ROS accumulation.

* Establish containment and bioethical compliance (BSL-2 or higher).

# Expected Results

* Partial expression of photosynthetic proteins in melanocytes.

* Evidence of light-driven electron transport or ATP generation.

* Insights into compatibility limits between mammalian and photosynthetic machinery.

* Foundational knowledge for designing hybrid bioenergy cells or novel photobiological therapies.

# Challenges

* Proper folding and assembly of photosystems in a non-chloroplast environment.

* Energy imbalance and ROS (reactive oxygen species) toxicity.

* Necessity of specialized lipid membranes for charge separation.

* Immunogenic and ethical considerations in human applications.

# Applications (Long-Term Vision)

* Bioenergy: Development of self-sustaining cellular systems.

* Medicine: Light-assisted metabolic support for skin grafts or wound healing.

* Synthetic biology: Creation of photosynthetic mammalian cell lines as model systems.
